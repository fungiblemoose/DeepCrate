# DeepCrate

DeepCrate is a Swift-native macOS app for DJs. It scans your library, analyzes BPM/key/energy, builds sets from natural language prompts, explains transition quality, highlights weak gaps, and exports playlists.

## Status

- Primary product: **Swift app** in `DeepCrateMac/`
- Current backend: **Python bridge** (`deepcrate/mac_bridge.py`) for analysis/planning/discovery/export/database
- Legacy Python GUI: kept for compatibility, no longer the primary UI

## What Works Today

- Native macOS SwiftUI interface with liquid-glass styling
- Library scan + analysis queue
- Track preview playback in Library and Sets pages
- Per-track and bulk reanalysis
- Manual metadata overrides and review queue
- AI set planning (cloud OpenAI or local Apple Foundation Model fallback)
- DJ-jargon-aware planning (`dnb`, `ukg`, `rollers`, `hardbass`, `afrohouse`, `tropical house`, etc.)
- Gap analysis with severity and plain-language guidance
- Export to M3U/Rekordbox XML

## Quick Start (Swift App)

### Requirements

- macOS 14+
- Xcode Command Line Tools
- Python 3.12 (for current backend bridge)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fungiblemoose/DeepCrate.git
cd DeepCrate
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e .
cp .env.example .env
```

Set keys in `.env` as needed:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=...
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=...
DATABASE_PATH=data/deepcrate.sqlite
```

### Run

```bash
cd DeepCrateMac
swift run
```

### Build

```bash
cd DeepCrateMac
swift build
```

## Planner Behavior

- The planner interprets broad + specific genre language and DJ shorthand.
- If a requested style is not in your library, it warns and falls back to the best available tracks.
- It does not hard-fail by default; it prioritizes usable output.

## Architecture (Current)

- `DeepCrateMac/`: SwiftUI app, local planner fallback, AVFoundation preview player
- `deepcrate/mac_bridge.py`: command bridge used by the Swift app
- `deepcrate/analysis/`: Python audio analysis (BPM/key/energy)
- `deepcrate/planning/`: Python planning, scoring, gaps
- `deepcrate/db.py`: SQLite persistence

## Swift-First Roadmap (Pure Swift End State)

1. Keep Swift UI as source of truth (done).
2. Move bridge commands into Swift services one area at a time:
   - scan/import
   - set planning orchestration
   - gap analysis + discovery
   - export
3. Replace Python analysis engine with native Swift DSP stack (Accelerate/AVFoundation/Core ML where appropriate), with regression tests against current outputs.
4. Keep SQLite but migrate data access to Swift-only layer.
5. Remove Python runtime dependency from app startup/build packaging.

## Developer Commands

### Swift

```bash
cd DeepCrateMac
swift build
swift run
```

### Python Tests

```bash
cd DeepCrate
.venv/bin/pytest -q
```

## Repo Layout

```text
DeepCrateMac/                 Swift app (primary UI)
deepcrate/analysis/           Python audio analysis
deepcrate/planning/           Python planning + scoring + gaps
deepcrate/mac_bridge.py       Swift <-> Python bridge
deepcrate/db.py               SQLite layer
tests/                        Python tests
```

## Notes

- Set previews require local file paths to still exist (common external-drive workflows are supported as long as the drive is mounted).
- Half/double-tempo matching is handled in transition scoring and genre filtering.
- Keys are stored in Camelot notation (example: `8A`).
