DeepCrate bundle notes

- The embedded Python bridge uses a bundled virtual environment under
  Contents/Resources/DeepCrateRuntime/.venv.
- User data and the default database path resolve to:
  ~/Library/Application Support/DeepCrate/data/deepcrate.sqlite
- API keys can be set in-app (Settings) and are forwarded to the bridge.
